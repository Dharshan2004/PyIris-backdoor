# The PyIris Project
The PyIris project is a modular, stealthy and flexible remote-access-toolkit. It allows users to dynamically build remote-access-trojan 
payloads (referred to as scouts) by loading and unloading specific modules (referred to as components), that grant scouts specific 
features. This allows you to cut down on file size and only use essential features making it less likely for antivirus to detect the 
scout. It also allows for highly customisable payloads that have low hard drive footprints as the scout never writes anything to the 
disk.

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
- Python 2.7
- Git

## Setting up PyIris (Windows)

First, clone this repository, make sure you have git installed.

```git clone https://github.com/angus-y/PyIris-backdoor```

Next, pip install pycaw, which can't be installed the standard way, so you'll need to install pycaw from this separate github repository

```pip install https://github.com/AndreMiras/pycaw/archive/master.zip```

Finally, install the rest of the required modules the standard way. Only install modules from the "setup/windows/requirements.txt" file 
as this section is for running the Windows edition of PyIris.

```pip install -r setup/windows/requirements.txt```

Upon running it the first time you should be greeted with the option to generate a key, this indicates everything has been installed
correctly.

## Setting up PyIris (Linux)

First, clone this repository, make sure you have git installed.

```git clone https://github.com/angus-y/PyIris-backdoor```

Next install an external dependency, xlib, required by pyperclip.

```sudo apt-get install xclip```

Then install pyalsaaudio through apt-get

```sudo apt-get install python-alsaaudio```

Finally, install the rest of the required modules the standard way. Only install modules from the "setup/linux/requirements.txt" file as
this section is for running the Linux edition of PyIris.

```pip install -r setup/linux/requirements.txt```

Upon running it the first time you should be greeted with the option to generate a key, this indicates everything has been installed
correctly.

## Updating PyIris
Change into the PyIris-backdoor folder first, then run

```git pull```

On windows to install any newly added third party modules or update then run

```pip install -r setup/windows/requirements.txt```

On linux to install any newly added third party modules or update then run

```pip install -r setup/linux/requirements.txt```

## Recommended OS
### PyIris was succesfully installed on the following operating systems
- Windows 10
- Kali Linux Rolling releases
- Ubuntu 16.04 and future releases
- Debian

# Basic Usage
## Windows

```PyIris.py```

If prompted to generate a key, either press enter or enter a key that you want to use.

## Linux

```python2 PyIris.py```

If prompted to generate a key, either press enter or enter a key that you want to use.

## Starting out
The ```help``` command is your friend! Simply run ```help``` to get a list of all commands you can use on a specific interface. For more 
detail about a specific command, run ```help <name of command>``` to get more in depth help about it. Alternatively you can use the 
```?``` command which is an alias for the help command. 

# FAQ

### Why cant the compiled scout I generated in Linux run on Windows? (Or vice versa)
PyIris utilizes Pyinstaller to compile its payloads. It is therefore not possible to cross-compile binaries. That means if you 
generate and compile a scout in Linux the binary only runs in Linux, it works the same for Windows. If you want to cross-compile 
Windows scouts for Linux I suggest you use wine and run PyIris from there.

### PyHook isnt installing on my Windows OS!
I have already included a PyHook wheel file in the setup/windows folder however that wheel works only for 64 bit versions of Windows.
You may have to manually install PyHook yourself. Go to [this site](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) and search for the 
PyHook wheel file that works for your Windows version and download it. Next, pip install using the name of that wheel file.

```pip install <name of pyhook wheel file>```

If you downloaded the correct pyhook wheel file it should install succesfully.

### Why are there more linux components (backdoor functions) than windows components...
Well this is due to several reasons. First, is the problem of open source code and mulitple distros. Linux has many distrubutions each 
linux distro may be different or have a different system structure than each other linux system. Creating components to cover all of 
them is incredibly difficult. Secondly, is support, simply put some linux systems just dont support some functions out of the box for 
python. Lastly is the fact that the terminal is much more powerful than cmd, therefore a lot more actions can be accomplished from the 
terminal than from cmd so there is no need to add extra components, your trusty linux/execute_command_bash will do the job for you

### Why are you using a raw text protocol isn't something like HTTP less suspicious to network analyst
Yes it is I should probably be using HTTP buuuuut I am just lazy. Perhaps in a future update but that requires rewriting a lot of the 
listener-scout protocol which could take some time.

### Hey I am a 1337 H4X0R and need to DDOS NSA and The Pentagon can you add a 1337 DDOS component
No lol
