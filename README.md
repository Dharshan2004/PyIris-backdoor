# The PyIris Project
The PyIris project is an attempt at creating a modular, stealthy and flexible remote-access-toolkit. It allows users to 
dynamically build remote-access payloads (referred to as scouts) by loading and unloading specific modules (referred to as components), 
that grant scouts specific features. This allows you to cut down on file size and only use essential features making it
less likely for antivirus to detect the scout. It also allows for highly customisable payloads that have low hard drive footprints as 
the scout never writes anything to the disk.
