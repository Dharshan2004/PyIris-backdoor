# Update 0.7.8.6
- Fixed a small OPSEC issue with chromepass dump where a random black window would pop up due to improper piping when task killing 
chrome.exe to gain access to the chrome password SQL database.

# Update 0.7.8.5
- The new generator ID system was slightly shaky so I changed it up and fixed it a bit with some reworks to the UI
- We're getting close to official release, 80% through alpha :)

# Update 0.7.8
Whoopsies, skipped 0.7.7 and 0.7.7.5 changelog entry
- Added a small minor update to the way generator IDs are selected. Now you can use commas to select multiple IDs and dashes for ranges
eg . load_com 1,2,3-5 loads components of ID 1,2,3,4,5
- minor update to loading interface the ID of the components/encoder are displayed in brackets when showing whether loading was 
successful or not
- refactored the load_com, load_enc, more_com, more_enc modules to be more modular

# Update 0.7.6 
:fireworks::fireworks::fireworks::fireworks::fireworks::fireworks::fireworks::fireworks::fireworks:
- ^Those are fireworks. HAPPY NEW YEEEAAARRRR, NEW YEAR NEW ME AMIRITE (no im not)
- Added new encoders after so long, so far only one, the base64 encoder
- New concept known as the "Encoder stack" its a stack based encoding format where encoding traverses downwards
- Loop encoding works as well so you can encode one scout with the same encoder multiple times not sure if it helps but cool to have, 
nothing says I'm a FUD payload then a python file base64 encoded 100 times
- Made the scout show command more useful now it displays and filters whether scouts are connects through reverse or bind TCP
- changed the load command to load_com (component) command so I can include a load_enc (encoder) command same for unload commands. The 
show command remains the same (show components, show encoders)

# Update 0.7.5
- Added option to choose multiple bases
- Now supports bind tcp scouts, access it with the new "bind" option

# Update 0.7.4
- Small but crucial update to the compiler so it now supports pyinstaller compilations that DONT have the --onefile option leading to 
non-packed binaries
- Added a new custom prompt for components that require manual intervention from users
- Reworded some stuff for accuracy


# Yearly update (0.7.2)
Its been about a year since PyIris has come out (WOW happy 1 year anniversary) so heres a quick consolidation of what I've done and 
plan to do.

## First up the changelog
- murdered a few bugs 
- replaced the names of the startup functions
- fixed a path writing error in the persistence module
- updated requirements file to use a new version of cv2 that solves a bug within the webcam module where webcam light would not turn off

## Next up, the roadmap
- Planning on adding encryption between communications? Details are very hazy. There may be more than 1 base component users can choose 
to use should it happen!
- Planning to add 1337 45cii b4n3r5 cause even metasploit has them. Just for fun and some eye candy its not hard so they'll come out 
pretty quickly 
- Of course I will continue to build on my database of components planning on adding some to help in pivoting through networks and 
lateral movement
- Writing a wiki is also on the agenda, unfortunately PyIris' "help" may not be enough.
- Code obfuscation and encryption, to circumvent AV I need to create custom encoders for scouts that could be layered on top of each 
other, eg XOR on top of base64 on top of AES encryption. This will be part of the genretor interface
- Thinking of adding powershell/bash script support so scouts can execute uploaded bash/powershell scripts
- Oh yeah also PyIris is still in Alpha I'm thinking of moving it to BETA bug testing and eventual OFFICIAL RELEASE (v1.0.0) after
completing all the roadmap objectives here, that will take time though, Im still a student and have middle school stuff to deal with...

## Conclusion
I dont expect development of PyIris to be moved to beta until late June maybe??? I still have tons of cool ideas for this project that 
may be put in during development. Dont expect a definite release date or anything. I doubt anyone will read this far but if so MERRY 
CHRISTMAS and thank you for supporting the development of PyIris, seriously just cloning it or star-ing it gives me life.
